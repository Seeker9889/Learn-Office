<h1>Learn Word, Part 1</h1>
<p>Computer programs are like cars; the maker releases a new model every few years. For example, you may have the Word made for 2013, or perhaps Word 2010. I'll assume you're using Microsoft Word 2013 for these tutorials. A lot will carry over into other versions of Word, but my pictures might look different from your copy of Word.</p>

		<li><p>Word gives you a ton of pre-formatted documents, called templates. You can select a business letter, an announcement, whatever. But you're here to learn how to make those yourself, so click "Blank Document" and let's do this.</p>

	<li>Welcome to Word</li>
	<ol class="two">
		<li><p>This is your workspace, your canvas, your blank piece of paper. You could just start typing and have a report done before too long, but your boss/teacher/prof will say something about "Formatting" and "MLA" and "Lazy." Forget them for now and type something.</p>
		<img src=".\TutorialImages\WordBlank.png" title="Word Workspace" alt="Plain white paper" width=600 height=500></li>
		<li><p>Perfectly legible, unlike my handwriting. However, this text is the beginning of a paragraph, and paragraphs should be indented. Right-click on the text you just typed and select "Paragraph"</p>
		<img src=".\TutorialImages\WordParagraphRightClick.png" title="Context Menu, Paragraph" alt="Right-click menu" width=600 height=300></li>
		<li><p>You have a lot of options here, but our goal for now is just to indent. In that "Indention" space in the middle, click on the gray arrow under "Special" and select "First line". Hit the Enter key, and you should now have some nice indented text.</p>
		<p>Incidentally, if you had selected "Hanging" under "Special," you would have every line in your paragraph <i>except</i> the first line indented. Generally you do that for works cited pages.</p>
		<img src=".\TutorialImages\WordParagraphMenu.png" title="Paragraph Menu" alt="Paragraph Menu for indenting" width=600 height=500></li>
		<br>
		<li>Some basic typing tools:
			<ul>
				<li>Press Enter to start a new paragraph</li>
				<li>Press Backspace to erase the letter just before your current location (that blinking line)</li>
				<li>Press Delete to erase the letter just after your current location</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><p>You can keep on typing until you have a paragraph or two, but if you don't want to type, copy and paste in some text. Do that by clicking and, while holding the mouse button down, dragging the mouse over the text until it's all highlighted blue. Once it's selected, release the mouse and type Ctrl+c (that is, the Ctrl and c keys at the same time). This is called Copying. How 'bout copying this lovely poem?</p>
		<block>
		Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
		Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
		Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
		One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
		In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
		One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
		One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
		In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</block>
		<br>
		<br>
		You can select like that in Word, too.</p></li>
		<li><p>Let's put that text into Word. Click where in your document you want to put the copied text and press Ctrl+v to "Paste" the text in. In my example, I put the text at the end of my current paragraph.</p>
		<p>Your text might not look quite right. Maybe the font is different from what you already have. That's because the font in this website might be different from the font you've been typing with. Word can automatically fix that, and it does so with this little menu.</p>
		<img src=".\TutorialImages\WordPasteType.png" title="Paste Menu" alt="Paste Menu" width=600 height=300>
		<p>Click on that menu and select the option on the far right. It should have an "A" on the icon. Once you click that, your document will look more like this:</p>

			<li>Right-click text to find a Paragraph menu.</li>
			<li>The Paragraph menu lets us change line indentation.</li>
			<li>Select text by clicking and dragging over the words.</li>

	<li>Fonts and spacing</li>
	<ol class="two">
		<li><p>Some people cringe when they see words like <span style="font-family: Papyrus, sans-serif">this</span> in a presentation. Others can't stand to read <span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif">this</span> in a paper. Let's learn how to make those people happy by changing the font of our Word document.</p>
		<p>By default, the letters in Word look something like this:
		<br>
		<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif">Fear my font!</span>
		<br>
		Compare to this:
		<br>
		<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Fear my font!</span>
		</p>
		<p>The difference is the font--that is, the forms of the letters used. The extra notches and lines on the edges of the letters in the second example are called "serifs," so we call the font a serif font. The font in the first example, without the notches, is thus called a "sans-serif" or simply "sans" font. The terms are not terribly important so long as you can recognize, "Huh, this font has the notches."</p>
		<p>Select all the text in your document. You can do that by clicking and dragging, or you can use the Select All command: click somewhere on your document, then press Ctrl+a.</p>
		<img src=".\TutorialImages\WordSelectAll.png" title="Select All" alt="All text is highlighted" width=600 height=300>
		<br>
		<p>Arrow A shows what your text should look like now. Click on the little gray drop-down arrow that Arrow B is pointing at.</p>
		<img src=".\TutorialImages\WordFontMenu.png" title="Font Menu" alt="Lots of fonts" width=400 height=500>
		<br>
		<p>If you <i>know</i> what font you want, scroll down this alphabetized list or type it in and press the Enter key. Otherwise, have a look. Click on a font to change your selected text's font. (Naturally, if you don't want to change the font of all the text, you can select specific bits instead of doing a Select All). Some of these fonts are serif, some aren't. Some are legible (the most important criterion for formal document fonts), and some, well, look like this (Vladimir Script is the font, in case you were curious):</p>
		<img src=".\TutorialImages\WordFancyFont.png" title="Overly-fancy font" alt="Fancy cursive font" width=600 height=200>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><p>Here are your go-to fonts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Times New Roman: You really can't go wrong with this one. Serif, simple, and you can easily tell when a word is <i>italicized</i></span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif">Calibri: A safe sans-serif, as sans-serifs go. I'm not a huge fan of Calibri, but it's very legible. Again, Word defaults to this, so it's a fine choice.</span></li>
				<li><span style="font-family: Georgia">Georgia: Another easy-to-read serif. Georgia takes up a bit more space than Times New Roman does.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you stick to these fonts, you do well.</p>
